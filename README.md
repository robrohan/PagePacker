# PagePacker

PagePacker was an application written in the early 2000s that let you
build little pocket sized notebooks. It was put out by _Big Nerd
Ranch_ and written by _Aaron Hillegass_. [Original
Post](https://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/pagepacker-makes-pocket-sized-books/)

I had found the application quite useful, for on-the-go-notes and
making little pocket zines.

Here is what the application looks like:

## Is this the original?

When I went looking for the application, it seems it had fallen into
the void of the internet.

Luckily, Aaron open sourced the application back in 2007:

> November 5, 2007 | Mac	
> I am celebrating the arrival of Mac OS X 10.5 by making the source code to PagePacker available. Here is the compiled application.

With a bit of digging around I've found the original application
source, and I've just put it here.
